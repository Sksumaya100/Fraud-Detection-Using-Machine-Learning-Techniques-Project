# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Overview

Fraud detection is a critical application in financial transactions, aiming to identify and prevent fraudulent activities using advanced machine learning techniques. This project implements various machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions and enhance security.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Real-time fraud detection capability

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of transactional records, including details such as transaction amount, timestamp, and customer information. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

## Machine Learning Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (optional, for deep learning approach)

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated based on:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of deep learning models such as LSTMs and CNNs
- Integration with real-time fraud detection systems
- Feature selection techniques to enhance model accuracy
